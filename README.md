# Personal Photo Gallery
This project was originally started as my final project in CS 193X. It is an image/video/song gallery where you can create galleries and upload images, videos and songs to them. 
All gallery items are annotatable with a title [required, unchangeable] and description [optional, changeable], and you can also make general annotations about the gallery 
itself in the notes section to the right of the gallery. Items that can be added to the gallery include images/videos uploaded from your computer, images/videos from a URL, 
YouTube URLs, and Spotify tracks/albums through their URL. Other features of this application include the ability to delete whole galleries, deleting individual gallery items,
and renaming galleries.
If you need help with the application, the home page has visual examples of all the features!
